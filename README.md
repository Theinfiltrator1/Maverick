# Maverick
respository 
My name is jessica,  I'm so very
Fly, oh my, it's a lil' bit scary
Boys wanna marry, looking at my derri-
Ere, you can stare but if you touch it I'mma bury
Pretty as a picture, sweeter than a swisher
Mad 'cause I'm cuter than the girl that's witchya
I don't gotta talk about it, baby you can see it
But if you want, I'll be happy to repeat it
